# prio_max_afe
Short implementation of the max-AFE described in Prio: Private, Robust, and Scalable Computation of Aggregate Statistics


This is an implementation of the maximum AFE that is described in Prio: Private, Robust, and Scalable Computation of Aggregate Statistics from Corrigan-Gibbs and Boneh written from 2017. Their protocol Prio can be used to aggregate sensitive distributed client data via secret-sharing to provide privacy.
It further ensures some nice properties that prevent from malicious clients.

In regards of my bachelor's thesis, I created this piece of code to show the correct execution of the AFE that is used to compute the maximum of all clients' secrets.
